# Hanzo Improvement Proposals (HIPs)

Hanzo Improvement Proposals (HIPs) are the primary mechanism for proposing new features, gathering community input, and documenting design decisions for the [Hanzo AI](https://hanzo.ai) ecosystem featuring Hamiltonian Large Language Models (HLLMs). This process ensures that changes to the Hanzo platform are transparently reviewed and achieve community consensus before implementation.

## What is a HIP?

A Hanzo Improvement Proposal (HIP) is a design document that provides information to the Hanzo community about a proposed change to the system. HIPs serve as the formal pathway to introduce improvements and build agreement on their adoption. They are used for:
- Proposing new Hamiltonian LLM architectures and Active Inference integration
- Defining standards for agent frameworks with Expected Free Energy minimization
- Collecting community input on AI infrastructure
- Documenting design decisions for multimodal systems with IEEE 2874 interoperability

## Quick Start

- 📖 New to HIPs? Begin with HIP-0, which provides an overview of the Hanzo AI architecture
- 🚀 Create a new HIP: Use the provided template to scaffold a proposal draft
- 📋 View all HIPs: See [docs/INDEX.md](./docs/INDEX.md) for a complete list
- 🔍 Check status: See [docs/STATUS.md](./docs/STATUS.md) for current status

## HIP Process

1. 💡 **Have an idea** – Discuss with the community
2. 📝 **Draft your HIP** – Use the template provided
3. 🔄 **Submit a Pull Request** – To the hanzoai/hips repository
4. 👥 **Get reviewed** – HIP editors review for completeness
5. 🤝 **Build consensus** – Community discussion and feedback
6. ⏰ **Last Call** – Final 14-day review period
7. ✅ **Final** – Accepted as standard

## Types of HIPs

- **Standards Track**: Technical changes affecting Hanzo AI
  - Core: AI models, consensus, infrastructure
  - Interface: APIs, protocols, standards
  - HAC (Hanzo AI Comments): Application-layer standards
- **Meta**: Process proposals
- **Informational**: Guidelines and best practices
