# HIP-003: DSO (Deprecated - See ZIP-001)

**Status**: Deprecated  
**Type**: Protocol Specification  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Deprecated**: 2025-10-28  
**Authors**: Originally Hanzo Industries Inc, now Zoo Labs Foundation  
**See**: [ZIP-001 (DSO)](https://github.com/zooai/papers/blob/main/zips/ZIP-001-dso.md)

## Notice

**This HIP has been deprecated and moved to Zoo Labs Foundation.**

Decentralized Semantic Optimization (DSO) was originally developed as part of Hanzo's research but has been properly attributed to **Zoo Labs Foundation** as ZIP-001, reflecting the correct ownership and focus:

- **Hanzo AI Inc** provides the base infrastructure:
  - HIP-002 (ASO): Active Semantic Optimization with TF-GRPO and PoE
  - HIP-004 (HMM): Hamiltonian Market Maker for compute pricing
  - PoAI: Proof of AI consensus mechanism

- **Zoo Labs Foundation** extends with decentralization:
  - ZIP-001 (DSO): Byzantine-robust prior aggregation
  - Decentralized storage (IPFS/Arweave)
  - Multi-agent consensus mechanisms

## Co-Development History

This protocol represents **years of collaborative research** between Hanzo AI Inc (Techstars '24) and Zoo Labs Foundation (501c3):

- **2024 Q1-Q2**: Hanzo develops ASO (HIP-002) for single-agent adaptation
- **2024 Q3**: Zoo extends ASO with Byzantine-robust aggregation → DSO
- **2024 Q4**: Integration with Hanzo Network's HMM (HIP-004)
- **2025 Q1**: Production deployment on Hanzo L1 infrastructure
