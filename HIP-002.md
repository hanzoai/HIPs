# HIP-002: AI/Blockchain Convergence Architecture

## Status
In Development

## Abstract
Defines the architecture for converging AI and blockchain technologies, enabling decentralized AI inference, on-chain model verification, and consensus-based ML computations.

## Specification

### Core Components

#### 1. On-Chain Model Registry
- Model metadata stored on-chain
- ML-DSA signatures for authenticity
- IPFS/Arweave for model storage
- Version control and updates

#### 2. Decentralized Inference
- Multi-node inference for critical decisions
- Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus
- Result aggregation and verification
- Encrypted inputs/outputs (ML-KEM)

#### 3. Zero-Knowledge ML Proofs
- Prove correct inference without revealing model/data
- zkSNARKs for small models
- Optimistic rollups for large models
- Fraud proof challenges

#### 4. Inference Marketplace
- Request/bid system for compute
- Reputation-based node selection
- Slashing for incorrect results
- Fee distribution mechanism

### Transaction Types
```rust
enum AITransaction {
    DeployModel { hash: [u8; 32], metadata: String },
    InferenceRequest { model: [u8; 32], input: Vec<u8>, fee: u128 },
    InferenceResult { request: [u8; 32], output: Vec<u8>, proof: Vec<u8> },
    Challenge { result: [u8; 32], evidence: Vec<u8> },
}
```

### Consensus Rules
1. Minimum 3 nodes for inference consensus
2. 2/3 agreement required for result acceptance
3. Outliers slashed and excluded
4. Proof verification before finalization

## Implementation Timeline
- Q1 2025: Model registry and basic inference
- Q2 2025: ZK proof system
- Q3 2025: Full marketplace launch
- Q4 2025: Federated learning support

## Security Considerations
- Model poisoning prevention
- Input privacy protection
- Output integrity verification
- Node collusion resistance

## Economic Model
- Inference fees: 0.1-1% of compute cost
- Node rewards: 80% of fees
- Treasury: 15% of fees
- Burn: 5% of fees
