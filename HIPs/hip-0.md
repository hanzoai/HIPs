# HIP-0: Hanzo AI Architecture & Framework

## Abstract

This document outlines the Hanzo AI architecture, development framework, and the Hanzo Improvement Proposal (HIP) process. It serves as the foundational reference for understanding Hanzo's AI infrastructure, multimodal capabilities, and community governance model.

## Hanzo AI Overview

### Evolution: From Web2.0 to Blockchain AI

Hanzo began as **hanzo.ai** in the Web2.0 era, pioneering AI infrastructure and services. We've now evolved to **hanzo.network**, launching initially as L2 on Lux Network with a clear path to sovereign L1 status, bringing our AI expertise to the blockchain ecosystem.

**Timeline:**
- **Web2.0 Era (hanzo.ai)**: AI infrastructure, enterprise services, and foundational model development
- **Blockchain Launch (hanzo.network)**: Initial L2 deployment on Lux Network
- **Sovereignty Upgrade**: Forthcoming transition to full sovereign L1
- **Current Architecture**: Hybrid web2/web3 with progressive decentralization

### Current Architecture

Hanzo is operating as an L2 on Lux Network with imminent sovereign L1 upgrade:

**Phase 1 (Live Now)**: 
- Initial EVM chain deployed as L2 on Lux Network
- Basic AI infrastructure and tokenomics active

**Phase 2 (Next)**: 
- Launch of HMM chain with native DEX functionality
- Sovereign L1 upgrade with full independence

1. **Current Status**: Operating as L2 EVM chain on Lux Network
2. **Next Upgrade**: HMM chain launch → Sovereign L1 transition
3. **AI-Native Chain**: Optimized for model training and inference
4. **HMM Native DEX**: Decentralized exchange for AI compute resources
5. **Multimodal AI Models**: Text, vision, audio, and 3D understanding
6. **Per-User Model Ownership**: Every user owns their AI as an asset
7. **Quantum-Secure**: Full quantum safety via Lux Network Q-Chain quantum rollups
8. **Native Token**: HANZO for governance, compute, and training rewards

### Technical Architecture

```yaml
Current Status: L2 EVM chain on Lux Network (Live)
Next Phase: HMM chain launch with sovereign L1 upgrade
Consensus: AI-optimized Proof of Intelligence (PoI)
Block Time: 2 seconds
Finality: Instant (single-slot)
Validators: AI nodes with GPU requirements
Native Token: HANZO
Quantum Safety: Lux Network Q-Chain quantum rollups
Compute DEX: HMM (Hanzo Market Maker) for AI resources

Upgrade Path:
  Phase 1 (Live): L2 EVM chain on Lux
  Phase 2 (Next): HMM chain + Sovereign L1
```

### Quantum Safety via Q-Chain

Hanzo achieves full quantum safety through Lux Network's Q-Chain quantum rollups:

```yaml
Q-Chain Integration:
  - Quantum Rollups: All transactions quantum-resistant
  - PQC Algorithms: NIST-approved ML-KEM/ML-DSA
  - Cross-Chain Security: Quantum safety across EVM and HMM chains
  - Future-Proof: Ready for quantum computing era
  - Zero-Knowledge: Optional ZK proofs for privacy
```

### HMM Native DEX

The **HMM (Hanzo Market Maker)** is our native decentralized exchange specifically designed for AI compute resources:

```yaml
HMM Features:
  - Compute Resource Trading: Buy/sell GPU time, model inference, training slots
  - Dynamic Pricing: Market-based pricing for AI compute
  - Resource Pools: Liquidity pools for different compute types
  - Instant Settlement: Sub-second compute allocation
  - Quality Metrics: Performance-based pricing adjustments
  - Cross-Chain Bridge: Access compute from Lux, Ethereum, and other chains
  - Quantum-Safe: All transactions protected by Q-Chain
```
