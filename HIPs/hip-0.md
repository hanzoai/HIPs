# HIP-0: Hanzo AI Architecture & Framework

## Abstract

This document outlines the Hanzo AI architecture, development framework, and the Hanzo Improvement Proposal (HIP) process. It serves as the foundational reference for understanding Hanzo's AI infrastructure, multimodal capabilities, and community governance model.

## Hanzo AI Overview

### Evolution: From Web2.0 to Blockchain AI

Hanzo began as **hanzo.ai** in the Web2.0 era, pioneering AI infrastructure and services. We've now evolved to **hanzo.network**, operating as a Layer 2 on Lux Network, bringing our AI expertise to the blockchain ecosystem.

**Timeline:**
- **Web2.0 Era (hanzo.ai)**: AI infrastructure, enterprise services, and foundational model development
- **Blockchain Era (hanzo.network)**: L2 on Lux Network with native AI compute marketplace
- **Current Architecture**: Hybrid web2/web3 with progressive decentralization

### Current Architecture

Hanzo operates as a Layer 2 blockchain on Lux Network, specialized for AI infrastructure and model ownership:

1. **L2 on Lux Network**: Leveraging Lux's security and consensus
2. **AI-Native Chain**: Optimized for model training and inference
3. **HMM Native DEX**: Decentralized exchange for AI compute resources
4. **Multimodal AI Models**: Text, vision, audio, and 3D understanding
5. **Per-User Model Ownership**: Every user owns their AI as an asset
6. **Quantum-Secure**: Inherited PQC from Lux Network
7. **Native Token**: HANZO for governance, compute, and training rewards

### Technical Architecture

```yaml
Chain Type: Layer 2 on Lux Network
Consensus: Inherited from Lux with AI validation layer
Block Time: 2 seconds
Finality: Instant (single-slot)
Validators: AI nodes with GPU requirements
Native Token: HANZO
Settlement: Lux Network mainnet
Compute DEX: HMM (Hanzo Market Maker) for AI resources
```

### HMM Native DEX

The **HMM (Hanzo Market Maker)** is our native decentralized exchange specifically designed for AI compute resources:

```yaml
HMM Features:
  - Compute Resource Trading: Buy/sell GPU time, model inference, training slots
  - Dynamic Pricing: Market-based pricing for AI compute
  - Resource Pools: Liquidity pools for different compute types
  - Instant Settlement: Sub-second compute allocation
  - Quality Metrics: Performance-based pricing adjustments
  - Cross-Chain Bridge: Access compute from Lux, Ethereum, and other chains
```

## Architecture Components

### Hanzo Multimodal Models (HMMs)

Hanzo's proprietary multimodal AI models supporting:
- **Text**: Natural language understanding and generation
- **Vision**: Image understanding and generation
- **Audio**: Speech recognition and synthesis
- **3D**: Spatial understanding and generation
- **Cross-modal**: Unified representations across modalities

### Agent Framework

- **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directed task completion
- **Tool Use**: Integration with external tools and APIs
- **Memory Systems**: Long-term and working memory
- **Planning**: Multi-step reasoning and execution
- **Collaboration**: Multi-agent coordination

### Security Infrastructure

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-compliant ML-KEM/ML-DSA
- **TEE Integration**: Secure enclaves for sensitive operations
- **Privacy Tiers**: Adaptive security levels
- **Key Management**: Hanzo KBS for secure key handling

## HIP Process

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Idea**: Community discussion and refinement
2. **Draft**: Formal proposal creation
3. **Review**: Technical and community review
4. **Last Call**: Final review period (14 days)
5. **Final**: Accepted and ready for implementation
6. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer proposal

### Proposal Types

- **Standards Track**: Technical specifications
- **Meta**: Process and governance
- **Informational**: Best practices and guidelines

### Numbering Convention

- **0-99**: Core infrastructure and governance
- **100-199**: AI models and architectures
- **200-299**: Agent frameworks
- **300-399**: Tools and integrations
- **400-499**: Security and privacy
- **500+**: Application standards

## Development Principles

### AI-First Design
- Every component designed for AI workloads
- Optimized for inference and training
- Multimodal by default

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for inference
- Distributed training support
- Edge to cloud deployment

### Interoperability
- Open standards (MCP, OpenAI API)
- Multiple model provider support
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Security
- Quantum-resistant by design
- Defense in depth
- Privacy-preserving computation

## Community Governance

### Decision Making
- Rough consensus model
- Technical merit primary consideration
- Community input via forums and discussions

### Roles
- **Authors**: Propose and maintain HIPs
- **Editors**: Review and merge proposals
- **Implementers**: Build HIP specifications
- **Community**: Provide feedback and consensus

### Communication Channels
- GitHub: Code and proposals
- Forum: Long-form discussions
- Discord: Real-time chat
- Twitter: Announcements

## Implementation Requirements

### For HIP Authors
1. Clear problem statement
2. Detailed specification
3. Security considerations
4. Test cases
5. Reference implementation (when applicable)

### For Implementers
