# HIP-0: Hanzo AI Architecture & Framework

## Abstract

This document outlines the Hanzo AI architecture, development framework, and the Hanzo Improvement Proposal (HIP) process. It serves as the foundational reference for understanding Hanzo's AI infrastructure, multimodal capabilities, and community governance model.

## Hanzo AI Overview

### Evolution: From Web2.0 to Blockchain AI

Hanzo began as **hanzo.ai** in the Web2.0 era, pioneering AI infrastructure and services. We've now evolved to **hanzo.network**, launching initially as L2 on Lux Network with a clear path to sovereign L1 status, bringing our AI expertise to the blockchain ecosystem.

**Timeline:**
- **Web2.0 Era (hanzo.ai)**: AI infrastructure, enterprise services, and foundational model development
- **Blockchain Launch (hanzo.network)**: Initial L2 deployment on Lux Network
- **Sovereignty Upgrade**: Forthcoming transition to full sovereign L1
- **Current Architecture**: Hybrid web2/web3 with progressive decentralization

### Current Architecture

Hanzo operates as an L2 on Lux Network with a sovereign L1 upgrade path:

**Phase 1 (Live Now)**: 
- L2 EVM chain deployed on Lux Network
- AI infrastructure and $AI tokenomics active
- Integration with Lux infrastructure services

**Phase 2 (Next)**: 
- HMM chain launch with native DEX functionality
- Sovereign L1 upgrade maintaining Lux integration

**Key Components:**
1. **Blockchain**: L2 on Lux Network → Sovereign L1 (next)
2. **HMM DEX**: Native exchange for AI compute resources
3. **AI Models**: Multimodal (text/vision/audio/3D)
4. **Ownership**: Per-user model forks as assets
5. **Security**: Quantum-safe via Lux Q-Chain rollups
6. **Token**: $AI for governance, compute, training

**Lux Infrastructure** (see [Lux LIPs](https://github.com/luxfi/LIPs)):
- **Wallet**: Multi-sig via Lux Safe (LIP-1)
- **Exchange**: $AI trading on lux.exchange (LIP-2)
- **Bridge**: Cross-chain via Lux Bridge (LIP-3)
- **Identity**: SSO via Lux ID (LIP-4)
- **Consensus**: Quasar photonic selection (LIP-5)

### Technical Architecture

```yaml
Current Status: L2 EVM chain on Lux Network (Live)
Next Phase: HMM chain launch with sovereign L1 upgrade
Consensus: Proof of Compute (PoC) - miners provide compute
Block Time: 2 seconds
Finality: Instant (single-slot)
Validators: Compute providers with GPU resources
Native Token: $AI
Quantum Safety: Lux Network Q-Chain quantum rollups
Compute DEX: HMM (Hanzo Market Maker) for AI resources

Upgrade Path:
  Phase 1 (Live): L2 EVM chain on Lux
  Phase 2 (Next): HMM chain + Sovereign L1
```

### Proof of Compute (PoC) Consensus

Hanzo uses Proof of Compute where miners provide AI compute resources to secure the network:

```yaml
PoC Protocol:
  - Compute Mining: Miners provide GPU/TPU resources for AI tasks
  - Work Validation: Cryptographic proof of computation performed
  - Rewards: $AI tokens for validated compute contributions
  - Quality Metrics: Performance-based reward adjustments
  - Resource Types:
    - Model training compute
    - Inference serving
    - Fine-tuning operations
    - Embedding generation
```

### Quantum Safety via Q-Chain

Hanzo achieves full quantum safety through Lux Network's Q-Chain quantum rollups:

```yaml
Q-Chain Integration:
  - Quantum Rollups: All transactions quantum-resistant
  - PQC Algorithms: NIST-approved ML-KEM/ML-DSA
  - Cross-Chain Security: Quantum safety across EVM and HMM chains
  - Future-Proof: Ready for quantum computing era
  - Zero-Knowledge: Optional ZK proofs for privacy
```

### HMM Native DEX

The **HMM (Hanzo Market Maker)** is our native decentralized exchange specifically designed for AI compute resources:

```yaml
HMM Features:
  - Compute Resource Trading: Buy/sell GPU time, model inference, training slots
  - Dynamic Pricing: Market-based pricing for AI compute
  - Resource Pools: Liquidity pools for different compute types
  - Instant Settlement: Sub-second compute allocation
  - Quality Metrics: Performance-based pricing adjustments
  - Cross-Chain Bridge: Access compute from Lux, Ethereum, and other chains
  - Quantum-Safe: All transactions protected by Q-Chain
```
