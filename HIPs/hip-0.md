# HIP-0: Hanzo AI Architecture & Framework

## Abstract

This document outlines the Hanzo AI architecture, development framework, and the Hanzo Improvement Proposal (HIP) process. It serves as the foundational reference for understanding Hanzo's AI infrastructure, multimodal capabilities, and community governance model.

## Hanzo AI Overview

Hanzo AI is a sovereign Layer 1 blockchain launched from Lux Network, specialized for AI infrastructure and model ownership:

1. **Sovereign L1 Blockchain**: Independent consensus and validation
2. **AI-Native Chain**: Optimized for model training and inference
3. **Multimodal AI Models**: Text, vision, audio, and 3D understanding
4. **Per-User Model Ownership**: Every user owns their AI as an asset
5. **Quantum-Secure**: Inherited PQC from Lux Network
6. **Native Token**: HANZO for governance, compute, and training rewards

### Sovereignty Architecture

```yaml
Chain Type: Sovereign L1 (launched from Lux)

Block Time: 2 seconds
Finality: Instant (single-slot)
Validators: AI nodes with GPU requirements
Native Token: HANZO
Launch Method: Lux Sovereign Chain Protocol (LP-25)
```

```

### Hanzo Multimodal Models (HMMs)

Hanzo's proprietary multimodal AI models supporting:
- **Text**: Natural language understanding and generation
- **Vision**: Image understanding and generation
- **Audio**: Speech recognition and synthesis
- **3D**: Spatial understanding and generation
- **Cross-modal**: Unified representations across modalities

### Agent Framework

- **Autonomous Agents**: Self-directed task completion
- **Tool Use**: Integration with external tools and APIs
- **Memory Systems**: Long-term and working memory
- **Planning**: Multi-step reasoning and execution
- **Collaboration**: Multi-agent coordination

### Security Infrastructure

- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: NIST-compliant ML-KEM/ML-DSA
- **TEE Integration**: Secure enclaves for sensitive operations
- **Privacy Tiers**: Adaptive security levels
- **Key Management**: Hanzo KBS for secure key handling

## HIP Process

### Proposal Lifecycle

1. **Idea**: Community discussion and refinement
2. **Draft**: Formal proposal creation
3. **Review**: Technical and community review
4. **Last Call**: Final review period (14 days)
5. **Final**: Accepted and ready for implementation
6. **Superseded**: Replaced by newer proposal

### Proposal Types

- **Standards Track**: Technical specifications
- **Meta**: Process and governance
- **Informational**: Best practices and guidelines

### Numbering Convention

- **0-99**: Core infrastructure and governance
- **100-199**: AI models and architectures
- **200-299**: Agent frameworks
- **300-399**: Tools and integrations
- **400-499**: Security and privacy
- **500+**: Application standards

## Development Principles

### AI-First Design
- Every component designed for AI workloads
- Optimized for inference and training
- Multimodal by default

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for inference
- Distributed training support
- Edge to cloud deployment

### Interoperability
- Open standards (MCP, OpenAI API)
- Multiple model provider support
- Cross-platform compatibility

### Security
- Quantum-resistant by design
- Defense in depth
- Privacy-preserving computation

## Community Governance

### Decision Making
- Rough consensus model
- Technical merit primary consideration
- Community input via forums and discussions

### Roles
- **Authors**: Propose and maintain HIPs
- **Editors**: Review and merge proposals
- **Implementers**: Build HIP specifications
- **Community**: Provide feedback and consensus

### Communication Channels
- GitHub: Code and proposals
- Forum: Long-form discussions
- Discord: Real-time chat
- Twitter: Announcements

## Implementation Requirements

### For HIP Authors
1. Clear problem statement
2. Detailed specification
3. Security considerations
4. Test cases
5. Reference implementation (when applicable)

### For Implementers
1. Follow HIP specifications exactly
2. Include comprehensive tests
3. Document deviations
4. Provide migration guides

## Future Direction

### Short-term (Q1-Q2 2025)
- HMM v1.0 release
- Agent framework standardization
- MCP full integration

### Medium-term (Q3-Q4 2025)
- Distributed inference protocol
- Federated learning support
- Advanced multimodal capabilities

### Long-term (2026+)
- AGI research initiatives
- Neuromorphic computing
- Quantum AI algorithms
