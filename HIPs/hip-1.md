# HIP-1: Hanzo Multimodal Models (HMMs) Specification & HANZO Tokenomics

## Abstract

This proposal defines the architecture, capabilities, and standards for Hanzo Multimodal Models (HMMs), along with the HANZO token economics that power the AI infrastructure. HMMs are multimodal AI models with per-user fine-tuning, where every user owns their personalized model fork. The HANZO token incentivizes training, compute provision, and model development.

## Motivation

Current AI models are typically specialized for single modalities or use separate encoders for different modalities. Additionally, they use domain-specific fine-tuning which fundamentally fails users:

1. **Information Loss**: Separate models lose cross-modal relationships
2. **Inefficiency**: Multiple models increase computational overhead
3. **No Personalization**: Domain-specific models (medical, legal, etc.) still generic for individuals
4. **No User Ownership**: Users can't own their personalized AI
5. **Privacy Violations**: User data pooled for domain training

HMMs address these limitations by providing unified multimodal understanding with per-user fine-tuning where every interaction creates a personalized model fork.

## Specification

### Model Architecture

#### Unified Transformer Architecture
```python
class HMMArchitecture:
    modalities = ["text", "vision", "audio", "3d"]
    hidden_dim = 4096  # Base model
    num_layers = 48
    num_heads = 64
    context_length = 32768
    
    # Modality-specific encoders
    text_encoder: "Byte-level BPE"
    vision_encoder: "Vision Transformer patches"
    audio_encoder: "Mel-spectrogram transformer"
    3d_encoder: "Point cloud transformer"
    
    # Unified decoder
    decoder: "Autoregressive transformer"
```

### Model Variants

| Model | Parameters | Context | Modalities | Use Case |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| HMM-7B | 7B | 8K | Text, Vision | Edge deployment, personal devices |
| HMM-32B | 32B | 32K | Text, Vision, Audio | Standard per-user models |
| HMM-175B | 175B | 128K | All | Advanced personal assistants |
| HMM-1T | 1T | 256K | All + specialized | Research & collective intelligence |

**Note**: These are BASE models only. Every user interaction creates a personalized fork with user-specific LoRA adapters, making each user's model unique.

### Capabilities

#### Core Capabilities
1. **Cross-modal Understanding**: Understand relationships between modalities
2. **Any-to-Any Generation**: Generate any modality from any input
3. **Zero-shot Transfer**: Apply learning across modalities
4. **Compositional Reasoning**: Combine modalities for complex reasoning

#### Specific Tasks
- **Vision-Language**: Image captioning, VQA, visual reasoning
- **Audio-Language**: Speech recognition, audio description
- **3D-Language**: 3D scene understanding, spatial reasoning
- **Multimodal Generation**: Create images from text+audio, etc.

### Training Infrastructure

#### Base Model Training
- **Text**: 10T tokens from web, books, code
- **Images**: 5B image-text pairs
- **Audio**: 100K hours of audio with transcripts
- **3D**: 10M 3D scenes with annotations
- **Synthetic**: Generated multimodal data for alignment

#### Per-User Fine-Tuning (Automatic)
- **Data**: User's own interactions (encrypted)
- **Compute**: ~35ms per interaction for gradient update
- **Storage**: ~100MB per user for LoRA adapters
- **Privacy**: All training data stays encrypted with user's key
- **Ledger**: Every training operation recorded on-chain

**Key Difference**: Base models are trained once. Per-user models continuously evolve with every interaction, creating billions of unique models.

### Inference Optimization

#### Techniques
1. **Modality Routing**: Process only relevant modalities
2. **Sparse Attention**: Reduce computation for long contexts
3. **Quantization**: INT8/INT4 for edge deployment
4. **Caching**: KV-cache across modalities
5. **Batching**: Dynamic batching for different modalities

#### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <100ms for first token (HMM-32B)
- **Throughput**: >1000 tokens/second (batched)
- **Memory**: <16GB for HMM-7B inference

### Safety and Alignment

#### Safety Measures
1. **Content Filtering**: Multi-modal content moderation
2. **Watermarking**: Invisible watermarks in generated content
3. **Attribution**: Track training data influence
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Cross-modal debiasing techniques

#### Alignment Techniques
- **RLHF**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Constitutional AI**: Rule-based constraints
- **Multimodal Alignment**: Cross-modal consistency checks

## Rationale

### Why Unified Architecture?

A unified architecture enables:
- **Shared Representations**: Learn common patterns across modalities
- **Efficient Scaling**: Single model scales better than multiple
- **Emergent Capabilities**: Cross-modal understanding emerges naturally

### Why These Modalities?

Text, vision, audio, and 3D cover the primary human senses and most digital content:
- **Text**: Foundation of human knowledge
- **Vision**: Rich visual understanding

### Why Multiple Model Sizes?

Different applications have different requirements:
- **Edge**: HMM-7B for mobile and embedded
- **Cloud**: HMM-32B for standard applications
- **Enterprise**: HMM-175B for complex tasks
- **Research**: HMM-1T for pushing boundaries

## Backwards Compatibility

## HANZO Tokenomics

### Token Distribution
```yaml
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 HANZO
Initial Distribution:
  - Training Rewards: 30% (300M)
  - Compute Providers: 20% (200M)
  - Model Developers: 15% (150M)
  - Community Treasury: 15% (150M)
  - Team & Advisors: 10% (100M, 4-year vest)
  - Public Sale: 5% (50M)
  - Liquidity: 5% (50M)
```

### Token Utility

#### 1. Training Rewards
```solidity
contract TrainingRewards {
    uint256 constant REWARD_PER_INTERACTION = 0.01 HANZO;
    uint256 constant QUALITY_MULTIPLIER = 1-10x;
    
    function rewardTraining(
        address user,
        bytes32 modelId,
        TrainingOp memory op
    ) external {
        uint256 quality = assessQuality(op);
        uint256 reward = REWARD_PER_INTERACTION * quality;
        
        // User gets 70% for providing data
        mint(user, reward * 70 / 100);
        
        // Model improvers get 30%
        mint(modelId.owner, reward * 30 / 100);
    }
}
```

#### 2. Compute Pricing
```yaml
Inference Costs:
  - HMM-7B: 0.001 HANZO per 1K tokens
  - HMM-32B: 0.01 HANZO per 1K tokens
  - HMM-175B: 0.1 HANZO per 1K tokens
  
Training Costs:
  - Per-user fine-tuning: 0.0001 HANZO per interaction
  - Base model training: 1000 HANZO per epoch
```

#### 3. Model Ownership NFTs
```solidity
interface IModelNFT {
    // Mint cost increases with model performance
    function mintCost(uint256 performance) view returns (uint256) {
        return 10 HANZO * (1 + performance / 100);
    }
    
    // Staking for enhanced features
    function stakeForBoost(uint256 modelId, uint256 amount) external {
        require(HANZO.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount));
        modelBoosts[modelId] += calculateBoost(amount);
    }
}
```

#### 4. Governance
```solidity
contract HANZOGovernance {
    // Voting power based on staked HANZO
    mapping(address => uint256) public votingPower;
    
    // Proposal thresholds
    uint256 constant PROPOSAL_THRESHOLD = 100000 HANZO;
    uint256 constant QUORUM = 10000000 HANZO;
    
    struct Proposal {
        ProposalType pType; // ModelUpgrade, TokenomicsChange, etc.
        bytes data;
        uint256 forVotes;
        uint256 againstVotes;
    }
}
```

### Emission Schedule
```python
def calculate_emission(year):
    # Halving every 4 years
    initial_rate = 100_000_000  # HANZO per year
    halvings = year // 4
    return initial_rate / (2 ** halvings)

# Year 1-4: 100M HANZO/year
# Year 5-8: 50M HANZO/year
# Year 9-12: 25M HANZO/year
# etc.
```

### Burn Mechanisms
1. **Training Burn**: 10% of training rewards burned
2. **Model Minting**: 50% of mint fees burned
3. **Governance**: Failed proposals burn staked HANZO
4. **Quality Control**: Low-quality training burns rewards
