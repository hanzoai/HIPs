## Integration Points with Hanzo Ecosystem

### High Priority Integration Areas:
1. **Authentication**: Lux ID ↔ Hanzo AI identity management
2. **Wallet Operations**: Lux Safe ↔ Hanzo MCP tools
3. **Trading Infrastructure**: Lux Exchange ↔ Hanzo LLM financial services
4. **Cross-chain Operations**: Lux Bridge ↔ Hanzo multi-chain AI services
5. **Key Management**: Lux KMS ↔ Hanzo secure AI key storage

### Medium Priority Integration Areas:
1. **Governance**: Lux DAO ↔ Hanzo AI governance tools
2. **Data Analysis**: Lux Explorer ↔ Hanzo AI blockchain analytics
3. **NFT Services**: Lux Marketplace ↔ Hanzo AI NFT tools

### Low Priority Integration Areas:
1. **User Experience**: Lux Chat ↔ Hanzo AI conversation tools
2. **Development Tools**: Lux CLI/SDK ↔ Hanzo development framework

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize HIP Development**: Focus on high-priority applications first
2. **Define Standards**: Create detailed technical specifications for each HIP
3. **Prototype Integration**: Build proof-of-concept integrations
4. **Community Review**: Get feedback from both Lux and Hanzo communities
5. **Implementation**: Roll out standardized integrations across ecosystems

## Technical Architecture Considerations

The Lux ecosystem uses:
- **Go** for blockchain/infrastructure (Node, Consensus, Crypto)
- **TypeScript/React** for web applications (Safe, Exchange, DAO)
- **Docker/Kubernetes** for deployment
- **PostgreSQL** for data persistence
- **gRPC/REST** for service communication

This aligns well with Hanzo's technology stack and should facilitate smooth integration.
