# HIP-2: Hamiltonian Large Language Models (HLLMs) Specification

## Abstract

This proposal defines the architecture, capabilities, and standards for Hamiltonian Large Language Models (HLLMs). HLLMs are multimodal AI models with per-user fine-tuning, where every user owns their personalized model fork. These models support text, vision, audio, and 3D modalities with unified representations and cross-modal understanding.

## Motivation

Current AI models are typically specialized for single modalities or use separate encoders for different modalities. Additionally, they use domain-specific fine-tuning which fundamentally fails users:

1. **Information Loss**: Separate models lose cross-modal relationships
2. **Inefficiency**: Multiple models increase computational overhead
3. **No Personalization**: Domain-specific models (medical, legal, etc.) still generic for individuals
4. **No User Ownership**: Users can't own their personalized AI
5. **Privacy Violations**: User data pooled for domain training

HLLMs address these limitations by providing unified multimodal understanding with per-user fine-tuning where every interaction creates a personalized model fork, integrated with Active Inference principles for principled decision-making.

## Specification

### Model Architecture

#### Unified Transformer Architecture with Hamiltonian Dynamics
```python
class HLLMArchitecture:
    modalities = ["text", "vision", "audio", "3d"]
    hidden_dim = 4096  # Base model
    num_layers = 48
    num_heads = 64
    context_length = 32768
    
    # Modality-specific encoders
    text_encoder: "Byte-level BPE"
    vision_encoder: "Vision Transformer patches"
    audio_encoder: "Mel-spectrogram transformer"
    3d_encoder: "Point cloud transformer"
    
    # Unified decoder
    decoder: "Autoregressive transformer"
```

### Model Variants

| Model | Parameters | Context | Modalities | Use Case |
|-------|------------|---------|------------|----------|
| HLLM-7B | 7B | 8K | Text, Vision | Edge deployment, personal devices |
| HLLM-32B | 32B | 32K | Text, Vision, Audio | Standard per-user models |
| HLLM-175B | 175B | 128K | All | Advanced personal assistants |
| HLLM-1T | 1T | 256K | All + specialized | Research & collective intelligence |

**Note**: These are BASE models only. Every user interaction creates a personalized fork with user-specific LoRA adapters, making each user's model unique.

### Capabilities

#### Core Capabilities
1. **Cross-modal Understanding**: Understand relationships between modalities
2. **Any-to-Any Generation**: Generate any modality from any input
3. **Zero-shot Transfer**: Apply learning across modalities
4. **Compositional Reasoning**: Combine modalities for complex reasoning

#### Specific Tasks
- **Vision-Language**: Image captioning, VQA, visual reasoning
- **Audio-Language**: Speech recognition, audio description
- **3D-Language**: 3D scene understanding, spatial reasoning
- **Multimodal Generation**: Create images from text+audio, etc.

### Training Infrastructure

#### Base Model Training
- **Text**: 10T tokens from web, books, code
- **Images**: 5B image-text pairs
- **Audio**: 100K hours of audio with transcripts
- **3D**: 10M 3D scenes with annotations
- **Synthetic**: Generated multimodal data for alignment

#### Per-User Fine-Tuning (Automatic)
- **Data**: User's own interactions (encrypted)
- **Compute**: ~35ms per interaction for gradient update
- **Storage**: ~100MB per user for LoRA adapters
- **Privacy**: All training data stays encrypted with user's key
- **Ledger**: Every training operation recorded on-chain

**Key Difference**: Base models are trained once. Per-user models continuously evolve with every interaction, creating billions of unique models.

### Inference Optimization

#### Techniques
1. **Modality Routing**: Process only relevant modalities
2. **Sparse Attention**: Reduce computation for long contexts
3. **Quantization**: INT8/INT4 for edge deployment
4. **Caching**: KV-cache across modalities
5. **Batching**: Dynamic batching for different modalities

#### Performance Targets
- **Latency**: <100ms for first token (HLLM-32B)
- **Throughput**: >1000 tokens/second (batched)
- **Memory**: <16GB for HLLM-7B inference

### Safety and Alignment

#### Safety Measures
1. **Content Filtering**: Multi-modal content moderation
2. **Watermarking**: Invisible watermarks in generated content
3. **Attribution**: Track training data influence
4. **Bias Mitigation**: Cross-modal debiasing techniques

#### Alignment Techniques
- **RLHF**: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
- **Constitutional AI**: Rule-based constraints
- **Multimodal Alignment**: Cross-modal consistency checks

## Rationale

### Why Unified Architecture?

A unified architecture enables:
- **Shared Representations**: Learn common patterns across modalities
- **Efficient Scaling**: Single model scales better than multiple
- **Emergent Capabilities**: Cross-modal understanding emerges naturally

### Why These Modalities?

Text, vision, audio, and 3D cover the primary human senses and most digital content:
- **Text**: Foundation of human knowledge
- **Vision**: Rich visual understanding
- **Audio**: Speech and environmental sounds

### Why Multiple Model Sizes?

Different applications have different requirements:
- **Edge**: HLLM-7B for mobile and embedded
- **Cloud**: HLLM-32B for standard applications
- **Enterprise**: HLLM-175B for complex tasks
